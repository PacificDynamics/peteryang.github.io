## Using Sass to precompile the CSS

Use `sass/style.scss` then compile it to `css/style.css` to change the CSS
It will resolve all variable used in the SCSS. You can also directly change the themes.css, but it will be override if themes.scss is compiled into themes.css


* Install Sass
```
gem install sass
```

* Convert scss to css (basically juste changing variables)
```shell
sass sass/style.scss css/style.css
# All SCSS files:
sass sass/*.scss css/
```

* Tell Sass to watch the file or the whole scss directory and update the CSS every time the Sass file changes
```
sass --watch sass/style.scss:css/style.css
sass --watch scss:css
```

* How to use variables
```css
$nav-color-light: #0080FF;
.navbar-inverse {
  border-color: $nav-color-light;
}
```
